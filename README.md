# OpCoSerializer

OpCoSerializer is a header-only C++ 20 serialization library.

## Tests

To build the tests, use the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `test` directory.
For convenience, the `build.sh` script in the root of this repository can
be used to build the tests with `make`.
This script should be called from the root of the repository.

```sh
./build.sh
```
